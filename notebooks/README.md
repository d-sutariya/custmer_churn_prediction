# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains all the Jupyter notebooks related to the **Customer Churn Prediction Project**, from the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to end-to-end optimization with MLflow. The notebooks are organized systematically, offering a complete narrative of the data science journey in this project.

## Notebook Naming Convention

The naming convention of the notebooks is as follows:

- The first number (e.g., `0`) indicates the **phase** of the project.
- The second decimal number (e.g., `.01`) indicates the **notebook number** within that phase.
- The author's name (e.g., `deep`) is used for identification.
- The remaining part of the name provides a brief description of the notebookâ€™s content.

### Example
`0.01-deep-EDA.ipynb`

- `0`: Phase of the project
- `.01`: First notebook in phase 0
- `deep`: Author's name
- `EDA`: Description of the notebook's content, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### List of Notebooks

1. **Phase 0: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - `0.01-deep-EDA.ipynb`: In-depth exploratory data analysis, identifying key patterns and insights in the dataset. This notebook is a unique selling point, providing a comprehensive visual and statistical understanding of the data.

2. **Phase 1: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**
    - `1.01-deep-Data-Cleaning-and-Split.ipynb`: Cleaning and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring quality data for modeling.
    - `1.02-deep-Automated-Feature-Creation.ipynb`: Automatic feature engineering using Featuretools, creating complex features from the raw dataset to enhance model performance.

3. **Phase 3: Model Optimization and Experiment Tracking**
    - `3.01-deep-optimization.ipynb`: Initial model optimization techniques, improving model performance by tuning hyperparameters.
    - `3.02-deep-Ensembling-and-Optimization.ipynb`: Advanced optimization, including ensemble methods for better predictions and performance.
    - `3.03-deep-experiment-tracking-mlflow-dagshub.ipynb`: Tracking experiments, model versions, and performance using MLflow and DagsHub for complete transparency and reproducibility.

### Key Features of the Notebooks

- **Phase-wise Organization:** Each notebook builds upon the previous one, ensuring a clear progression from data analysis to model optimization.
- **Detailed Visuals & Insights:** The EDA notebook provides deep insights into customer churn patterns, a key part of this project's value.
- **End-to-End Workflow:** These notebooks demonstrate the entire lifecycle of the project, from data cleaning to advanced model optimization and experiment tracking.
