Instead of relying solely on common metrics and methods, I experimented with advanced techniques that often go overlooked. **As we all know , Feature Engineering is The most important part of the ML life cycle**. My approach leveraged automated feature engineering using the Featuretools library, allowing me to extract meaningful insights without needing telecom-specific expertise.\n","\n","I meticulously optimized multiple state-of-the-art models, including LightGBM, XGBoost, and ANN, using Optuna for hyperparameter tuning. While many focus on ensembling, I found success in fine-tuning individual models and ultimately selecting the best performer, rather than defaulting to a weighted ensemble.\n","\n","In a unique twist, I incorporated linear regression to explore hyperparameter relationships, aiming to predict combinations that could deliver exceptional performance. Although not all strategies were successful—like SMOTEd datasets and ROC AUC as a primary metric—I identified and honed in on the techniques that truly made a difference. This notebook is a comprehensive exploration of what works and what doesn’t, offering valuable lessons for anyone looking to push the boundaries of churn prediction modeling."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cad1d39a-3df3-45d6-a11a-fba18bb2f663","_uuid":"99760c75-9ec1-4c16-b094-6811f7daf622","trusted":true},"source":["# Detailed Summary and Rationale\n","\n","\n","### Data Loading and Preprocessing\n","\n","**DataLoader Class:**\n","- **Purpose:** Efficiently handle data loading and preprocessing tasks.\n","- **Details:** The `DataLoader` class initializes with the file path of the dataset, loads the data, preprocesses columns, and converts categorical variables to dummy variables.\n","- **Rationale:** Automating these tasks ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors. This modular approach makes the code more maintainable and reusable.\n","\n","### Train-Test-Validation Split\n","\n","**Stratified Sampling:**\n","- **Purpose:** Maintain the class distribution of the target variable across training, testing, and validation sets.\n","- **Details:** The data is split using stratified sampling to ensure that each set has a balanced representation of both churn and non-churn classes.\n","- **Rationale:** This approach helps in maintaining the performance metrics' validity and ensures that the model generalizes well across different datasets.\n","\n","### Handling Class Imbalance\n","\n","**SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):**\n","- **Purpose:** Address the issue of class imbalance in the dataset.\n","- **Details:** SMOTE generates synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the class distribution.\n","- **Rationale:** Balanced class distribution helps in improving the model's ability to correctly identify both churn and non-churn customers, thereby enhancing the recall and precision of the model.\n","\n","### Feature Engineering\n","\n","**Automated Feature Engineering with Featuretools:**\n","- **Purpose:** Generate new features automatically from the existing dataset.\n","- **Details:** The Featuretools library is used to create meaningful features by capturing relationships and interactions between different variables.\n","- **Rationale:** Feature engineering is critical for improving model performance. Automatically generating features can uncover hidden patterns and interactions that might not be immediately obvious.\n","\n","### Model Training and Selection\n","\n","**ModelTraining Class:**\n","- **Purpose:** Train various machine learning models (LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, Neural Network) and select the best-performing one.\n","- **Details:** The `ModelTraining` class includes methods to train different models with early stopping and feature importance calculation.\n","- **Rationale:** Using multiple models and selecting the best one based on performance metrics ensures that the final model is robust and well-tuned for the specific task.\n","\n","### Performance Metrics\n","\n","**Weighted Recall:**\n","- **Purpose:** Evaluate the model's ability to correctly identify the positive class (churn) while considering the class distribution.\n","- **Details:** Weighted recall gives more importance to the minority class, ensuring that the model does not ignore it in favor of the majority class.\n","- **Rationale:** In churn prediction, correctly identifying churners (the positive class) is crucial for taking preventive actions. Weighted recall helps in optimizing the model for this purpose.\n","\n","### Optimization\n","\n","**Optuna for Hyperparameter and Model Selection Optimization:**\n","- **Purpose:** Find the optimal hyperparameters and model selection to improve performance.\n","- **Details:** Optuna is used to conduct hyperparameter tuning, maximizing metrics such as ROC AUC, F1 score, and recall score. Additionally, Optuna optimizes the weights for the ensemble model.\n","- **Rationale:** Hyperparameter optimization and model selection are essential for enhancing model performance and ensuring that the model is well-suited to the data.\n","\n","### Ensemble Methods\n","\n","**Optimized Weights for Soft Voting Ensemble:**\n","- **Purpose:** Combine the predictions of multiple models to improve overall performance.\n","- **Details:** Optuna is used to optimize the weights for combining predictions from LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, and a neural network.\n","- **Rationale:** Ensemble methods leverage the strengths of different models, providing a more robust and accurate prediction by reducing individual model biases and variances.\n","\n","### Linear Regression on Optimized Models\n","\n","**Fitting Linear Regression:**\n","- **Purpose:** Capture the relationships between the hyperparameters and the model performance.\n","- **Details:** Linear regression is used to understand and predict how changes in hyperparameters affect model performance. By fitting a linear regression model, we aim to identify hyperparameter combinations that are likely to yield high performance.\n","- **Rationale:** This approach helps in fine-tuning the ensemble model by leveraging the insights gained from the linear regression model. It allows for the prediction of hyperparameter sets that are not directly tested but are inferred to perform well based on the regression model.\n","\n","### Sampler and Checker\n","\n","**Purpose:**\n","- Generate a uniformly distributed dataset of hyperparameters.\n","- Use the linear regression weights to predict the performance of these hyperparameters.\n","- Apply a performance threshold to select the best models.\n","\n","**Details:**\n","- The sampler creates a uniform distribution of hyperparameter values.\n","- The checker uses the linear regression model to predict the performance of these sampled hyperparameters.\n","- A performance threshold of 0.635 is applied to filter and select the models.\n","- Models that satisfy this threshold are then trained and further evaluated.\n","\n","**Rationale:**\n","- The uniform distribution ensures a comprehensive exploration of the hyperparameter space.\n","- The linear regression model helps in quickly estimating the performance of different hyperparameter sets, saving computational resources.\n","- Applying a performance threshold ensures that only the most promising models are selected for training, improving overall model efficiency and effectiveness.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5e038152-196d-4660-ba85-4063c289ff29","_uuid":"aa4af3db-4cb9-4a38-978d-6331ac81120c","trusted":true},"source":["## What Didn't Work\n","\n","- **Ensemble Methods:**\n","  - While ensembling is often used to improve model performance, in this case, the ensemble approach did not yield better results compared to individual models. The ensembles failed to outperform the best single model, suggesting that the combined predictions may have introduced additional noise or reduced the effectiveness of the model.\n","\n","- **SMOTEd Data:**\n","  - Applying SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset didn't enhance the model performance as expected. The generated synthetic samples may have introduced patterns that were too similar to existing data, leading to overfitting or not providing the desired generalization.\n","\n","- **ROC AUC as a Metric:**\n","  - The ROC AUC metric, while useful in many scenarios, was not as effective in this particular context. It may not have captured the critical aspects of model performance, especially when the focus was on correctly identifying churners (weighted recall being a better alternative).\n","\n","- **Linear Regression Fitting:**\n","  - Fitting linear regression to model the relationships between hyperparameters and performance didn't produce the expected improvements. The assumptions of linear regression might not have aligned well with the complexity of the hyperparameter interactions, leading to suboptimal predictions.\n","\n","## What Worked\n","\n","- **Automated Feature Engineering:**\n","  - The use of automated feature engineering, particularly through the Featuretools library, significantly enhanced the model’s performance. It allowed for the generation of meaningful features without needing deep domain expertise, providing a strong foundation for the models.\n","\n","- **Optimization of LightGBM:**\n","  - Hyperparameter optimization of the LightGBM model using tools like Optuna resulted in substantial performance improvements.

Critical Role of Feature Engineering in Machine Learning** 🚨\n","\n","In the rapidly evolving world of machine learning, one truth remains constant: **the quality of your features determines the quality of your model**. Feature engineering is not just another step in the pipeline; it is the foundation upon which your model's performance is built. Without robust, well-crafted features, even the most sophisticated algorithms can falter. \n","\n","Imagine you're an architect. You could have the most advanced tools and technology at your disposal, but if the building materials you use are subpar, the final structure will inevitably be weak. The same principle applies in machine learning—**feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into the critical building blocks that empower your model to achieve excellence and ```without exaggeration it is the most important part in the ML lifecycle```**.\n","\n","## 🛠️ **FeatureTools: The Architect of Your Model’s Success** 🛠️\n","\n","Enter **FeatureTools**—a powerful library that automates the process of creating meaningful features from your raw data. But make no mistake—this is not just automation for convenience's sake. FeatureTools is your blueprint for success, providing a systematic way to craft features that will enable your model to not only learn but to excel in predicting outcomes with precision.Let's learn this serious topic with fun.\n","\n","### **Why Feature Engineering Matters**\n","\n","- **Entities**: These are the ingredients—your raw datasets—like vegetables and spices. In this case, our training and test sets are the ingredients, and just like how each veggie might need to be chopped differently, each dataset needs its own unique index to keep things in order. i.e individual dataframe is named as an entity.\n","\n","- **EntitySet**: Think of this as your kitchen. It’s where you store all your ingredients (dataframes). Each dataset, like your training and test sets, gets its own special spot in this kitchen, labeled with unique names so they never get mixed up. i.e Set of dataframe(s) and their relations is called entityset.\n","  \n","\n","\n","- **Primitive Transformations**: Ever seen a chef quickly dice an onion into perfect little cubes? That’s what these transformations do to your data. They take your basic ingredients and slice them, dice them, and mix them in ways that create new, richer flavors—er, I mean features!. i.e Generating new features from individual features is called ``transformation``.\n","\n","- **Aggregation**: Picture a large pot where all the diced onions, tomatoes, and spices simmer together. Aggregation takes your data and combines it to extract meaningful patterns. It’s like boiling down all those ingredients into a rich, flavorful stock—perfect for adding depth to your model. i.e Generating features from combination of multiple features is called ``Aggregation``.\n","\n","\n","\n","## **Building a Model with Purpose**\n","\n","When you use FeatureTools, you're not just building a model—you’re constructing a solution with real-world impact. This isn’t just theory; **this is the practice of creating features that will enable your model to perform reliably in the most demanding production environments**.\n","\n","In our `Feature_Engineering` class, we’re taking this theory into practice. From setting up your EntitySet to generating and refining features, every step is a deliberate action to enhance your model’s performance. This is feature engineering with a purpose.\n","\n","1. **Create_Entityset**: First, we set up our kitchen with the `Create_Entityset` method. We organize our ingredients (datasets) neatly, making sure everything has its place. If our ingredients don’t come pre-labeled (indexed), our magical helpers create labels for us, ensuring nothing gets lost in the mix. i.e this method creates ``Entityset`` from multiple dataframe(s) and their relations.\n","\n","2. **add_dataframe**: Using this method we can add dataframe into the entity set.For that  we should provide dataframe_name,datframe,index(if your dataframe hasn't index you have to set make_index=True).\n","\n","2. **Generate_Features**: Next, we call on FeatureTools to start the real magic—transforming our raw ingredients into delicious features. It’s like watching a chef in action, taking raw veggies and turning them into a gourmet meal. Whether it's chopping (transformations) or slow-cooking (aggregations), our features get enhanced, refined, and prepped for the main event: feeding the model!. i.e this method generates features from raw data and combine it with target dataframe.\n","\n","3. **Cleaning and Alignment**: But even in the best kitchens, you need to tidy up. So, we clean the names, remove any duplicates, and ensure that everything is aligned perfectly between the training and test sets—no mismatched spices here!. i.e After feature engineering we will get **mutlilevel indexed** target dataframe. we have to convert it into normal dataframe. \n","\n","## **Important Terminologies**\n","\n","### Transformation Primitives\n","- **Transformation Primitives** are like little recipes that take one column and create new features by applying mathematical or logical operations. For example, if you have a column with dates, a transformation primitive could create a new column with the day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.).\n","\n","### Aggregation Primitives\n","- **Aggregation Primitives** are used when you have data grouped in some way, like sales data for different stores. These primitives combine the data in each group to create a single summary value, like the average sales per store or the total sales for each month.\n","\n","### Ignore Columns\n","- **Ignore Columns** are columns that you tell the program not to use when creating new features. Maybe these columns contain information that would give away the answer too easily (like a column that directly says whether a customer has left), or maybe they just aren't useful for your model.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["For more details visit featuretools [Documentation](https://featuretools.alteryx.com/en/stable/)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":65,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ca508150-5ad5-4e42-a31f-e00094d64d19","_uuid":"bb6cf1bc-32e3-4610-af4e-9fd92ee33d38","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["class Feature_Engineering:\n","    def __init__(self, train_set, test_set, df):\n","        self.train_set = train_set  # Training dataset\n","        self.test_set = test_set  # Test dataset\n","        self.entity_set = None  # Placeholder for entity set\n","        self.train_set_name = None  # Name of training dataset in entity set\n","        self.test_set_name = None  # Name of test dataset in entity set\n","        self.df = df  # Original DataFrame\n","\n","    def Create_Entityset(self, entity_id, train_set_name, test_set_name, index_name=None):\n","        # Check if index_name is not present in train and test sets\n","        if index_name not in self.train_set.columns and index_name not in self.test_set.columns:\n","            es = ft.EntitySet(id=entity_id)\n","            # Add train_set to the entity set with make_index=True\n","            es.add_dataframe(\n","                dataframe_name=train_set_name,\n","                dataframe=self.train_set, \n","                make_index=True,\n","                index=index_name,\n","                # time_index='tenure'  # Uncomment if using time index\n","            ) \n","            # Add test_set to the entity set with make_index=True\n","            es.add_dataframe(\n","                dataframe_name=test_set_name,\n","                dataframe=self.test_set,\n","                make_index=True,\n","                index=index_name,\n","                # time_index='tenure'  # Uncomment if using time index\n","            )\n","        else:\n","            es = ft.EntitySet(id=entity_id)\n","            # Add train_set to the entity set with existing index\n","            es.add_dataframe(\n","                dataframe_name=train_set_name,\n","                dataframe=self.train_set,\n","                index=index_name,\n","                # time_index='tenure'  # Uncomment if using time index\n","            )\n","            # Add test_set to the entity set with existing index\n","            es.add_dataframe(\n","                dataframe_name=test_set_name,\n","                dataframe=self.test_set,\n","                index=index_name,\n","                # time_index='tenure'  # Uncomment if using time index\n","            )\n","        self.entity_set = es  # Store the entity set\n","        self.train_set_name = train_set_name  # Store the training set name\n","        self.test_set_name = test_set_name  # Store the test set name\n","\n","    def __clean_feature_names(self, df):\n","        # Clean column names by replacing special characters with underscore\n","        cleaned_names = []\n","        for col in df.columns:\n","            clean_name = re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z0-9_]+', '_', col)\n","            cleaned_names.append(clean_name)\n","        df.columns = cleaned_names\n","        return df\n","\n","    def __remove_duplicate_columns(self, df):\n","        # Remove duplicate columns\n","        df = df.loc[:, ~df.columns.duplicated()]\n","        return df\n","\n","    def Generate_Features(self, trans_list=None, agg_list=None, ignore_columns=None, names_only=True):\n","        if names_only == False:\n","            # Generate features for training set\n","            # dfs generate features from data and merge them with target dataframe\n","            feature_df, feature_names = ft.dfs(\n","                entityset=self.entity_set, # for which entity set do you want to generate features.\n","                target_dataframe_name=self.train_set_name, # To Which dataframe features must be merged? \n","                trans_primitives=trans_list, # list of the transformations that you want to apply .\n","                agg_primitives = agg_list, # Aggregation primitives means methods that combine multiple rows like median,average,sum etc.\n","                max_depth=2, # Number of  transformation,aggregation  primitves  can be stacked upon each other.\n","                ignore_columns=ignore_columns, # columns that shouldn't use for feature engineering .

Optimization is the key process that allows us to fine-tune models, ensuring that they perform at their peak across various metrics. Optuna, a powerful hyperparameter optimization framework, plays a crucial role in this endeavor. By systematically searching the parameter space, Optuna helps us find the most effective model configurations, often uncovering improvements that might be missed through manual tuning.\n","\n","The pursuit of optimization should be taken very seriously by anyone involved in ML. It’s not merely about squeezing out the last bit of performance; it’s about understanding the intricacies of model behavior and the profound impact that well-tuned models can have on real-world applications. As you dive deeper into this code, let this mindset guide you: optimization is not a mere step but a cornerstone of advanced ML practice. Stay curious and serious about mastering this skill, as it will set you apart in the world of data science.\n","\n","## Key Terms and Their Significance\n","\n","- **Weighted Recall**: This is a custom metric defined as `0.65 * recall + 0.35 * f1`. The idea behind weighted recall is to combine the recall (sensitivity) and F1 score into a single metric, giving more weight to recall. This is particularly important in cases where false negatives (e.g., not detecting churn when it actually occurs) are more costly than false positives.\n","\n","- **Optuna**: Optuna is an open-source hyperparameter optimization framework that automates the search for optimal hyperparameters. In this code, Optuna is used to optimize various parameters of different models, such as learning rate, depth, and regularization parameters. Its efficiency comes from advanced sampling techniques like TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) and pruning algorithms like Hyperband, which help in finding the best model configurations faster.\n","\n","- **TPE Sampler**: This is a sampling algorithm used by Optuna that models the objective function using a Gaussian Mixture Model. It allows for efficient sampling of hyperparameters by focusing on promising regions of the parameter space, thus speeding up the optimization process.\n","\n","- **Hyperband Pruner**: This is a pruning algorithm that terminates unpromising trials early, allowing the optimizer to allocate more resources to promising candidates. It's particularly useful when the training process is computationally expensive.\n","\n","\n","- **Logloss**: Logloss is used as an objective function for binary classification models. It measures the uncertainty of predictions, penalizing both wrong predictions and those that are overly confident. Minimizing logloss helps in building models that are well-calibrated.\n","\n","- **Early Stopping**: This is a technique where training is stopped when the model's performance on a validation set ceases to improve after a certain number of rounds. It prevents overfitting by not allowing the model to train for too long.\n","\n","\n","Each of these components is critical to the model optimization process. By understanding and utilizing these terms effectively, you can drive your ML models to achieve superior performance, making them more reliable and impactful in practical

Today, we're diving into a sophisticated process where we harness the full potential of multiple models and fine-tune their performance to achieve the best results. \n","\n","1. **Sampling Hyperparameters**: We sample indices from the study dataframes for different models (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Neural Network). Each index corresponds to a unique set of hyperparameters. By doing this, we explore various configurations and their impact on model performance.\n","\n","2. **Fetching and Cleaning Parameters**: Once we have the indices, we retrieve the corresponding hyperparameters for each model. We then clean these parameters to ensure they are ready for training. This process is akin to preparing your ingredients before cooking—making sure they are in their best form.\n","\n","3. **Setting Fixed Parameters**: Besides the sampled hyperparameters, we set some fixed parameters to control aspects like verbosity or early stopping. These are like the constants in our recipe that don’t change but are crucial for consistency.\n","\n","### 🤝 **Combining Model Predictions: The Magic of Weighted Voting** 🤝\n","\n","After training our models with the selected hyperparameters, we combine their predictions using weighted voting. This is where the real magic happens:\n","\n","- **Training Models**: Each model (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and Neural Network) is trained on the training data and then used to make predictions on the validation data.\n","  \n","- **Weighting Predictions**: We assign weights to each model’s predictions based on their performance. Think of this as adjusting the volume of each instrument in our orchestra to get the perfect balance.\n","\n","- **Combining Predictions**: Using these weights, we combine the predictions from all models. This combined prediction is like a beautifully orchestrated piece of music, where each model's output contributes to the final performance.\n","\n","- **Evaluating Performance**: We calculate various performance metrics such as ROC AUC, F1 score, recall, and accuracy to evaluate the effectiveness of our combined predictions. This helps us understand how well our ensemble performs and guides us in refining our approach.\n","\n","### 🔧 **Why This Matters** 🔧\n","\n","This optimization process ensures that we are not just relying on a single model but leveraging the strengths of multiple models.

Why did I choose XGBoost, LightGBM, ANN, and CatBoost?**\n","- **Answer:** These models are known for their robustness and ability to deliver high performance with relatively quick training times. They are widely used for classification tasks and handle various types of data and feature complexities effectively.\n","\n","**2. Why did I write many classes and functions?**\n","- **Answer:** To ensure reproducibility and maintain a well-organized workflow. By encapsulating code in functions and classes, the project becomes more modular, easier to debug, and scalable for future enhancements.\n","\n","**3. Why did I use the Featuretools library for feature engineering?**\n","- **Answer:** Feature engineering is a crucial aspect of model performance. Since I lacked domain-specific knowledge in the telecom industry, an automated feature engineering approach like Featuretools was ideal. It enabled me to generate valuable features without requiring deep domain expertise, and I was impressed with the quality of the features it produced.\n","\n","**4. Why did I choose weighted recall as the evaluation criterion?**\n","- **Answer:** In churn prediction, accurately identifying customers who are likely to churn (the positive class) is essential for taking preventive actions. Weighted recall emphasizes the importance of correctly identifying these customers, helping to optimize the model's performance for this specific task.\n","\n","**5. Why did I opt for sampling instead of assigning higher weights to the minority class?**\n","- **Answer:** I wanted to experiment with how the models would perform without relying on class weights. In a different [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/deepsutariya/churn-modeling-to-deployment-mlflow-DagsHub), I explored the impact of increased class weights, but here, I focused on understanding the models' behavior with sampling techniques.\n","\n","**6. Why did I choose to optimize the original dataset, SMOTEd datasets, and featured datasets?**\n","- **Answer:** I was experimenting with different data configurations to assess how each impacted model performance. This approach allowed me to compare the effectiveness of original, SMOTEd, and feature-engineered datasets in driving model accuracy and generalization.\n","\n","**7. Why did I select ANN as the final model?**\n","- **Answer:** After training various models, I initially attempted to ensemble them and optimize the ensemble. However, the ensemble approach didn't yield the desired results. I then selected the top 5 individual models and tried an equal-weight ensemble, but this also underperformed. Ultimately, I chose the best-performing individual model, which was the ANN, as the final model for the project.\n","\n","\n","**8. Why did I use Optuna for hyperparameter optimization?**\n","- **Answer:** Optuna is a powerful tool for hyperparameter tuning, Best part of the oputna is ***Parallal Training***. It helped me find the best-performing model configurations, ultimately improving the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.\n","\n","**9. What role did linear regression play in the final model selection?**\n","- **Answer:** I used linear regression to capture the relationships between hyperparameters and model performance. This allowed me to predict additional hyperparameter combinations that might perform exceptionally well, further fine-tuning the final model.Unfortunatly , it didn't work. So i removed this part, If you want to experiment with that you can  visit old version (33) of this notebook.\n","\n","**10. Why did I use an ensemble of models instead of relying on a single model?**\n","- **Answer:** Ensembling helps to combine the strengths of different models, potentially leading to more robust and accurate predictions. Although the ensemble didn't outperform the best individual model in this case, it was important to explore this option to ensure that no potential performance gains were overlooked.\n","\n","**11. How did I handle the class imbalance in the dataset?**\n","- **Answer:** I experimented with both SMOTE and sampling techniques to balance the class distribution. This was crucial for ensuring that the model was not biased towards the majority class, thus improving its ability to correctly predict churners.\n","\n","**12.Where is the EDA section?**\n","- **Answer:** It is in the first notebook of this series."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Conclusion\n","\n","Congratulations!
