# Reports Directory Overview

The `reports/` directory is a critical component of the Customer Churn Prediction project, providing essential documentation and visualizations related to feature definitions, model optimization, and final predictions. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of its contents:

## Directory Structure

### 1. `feature_definitions/`
Contains the definitions of features used in the project, especially those generated by Featuretools. These definitions are crucial for reproducing the same features in new data and ensuring consistency across different datasets.

- **Purpose**: To provide a reference for the features created and used in the modeling process, allowing for accurate reproduction of features on new data.

### 2. `figures/`
Holds images and figures used to guide readers on how to access and interpret their experiments in the MLflow UI.

- **Purpose**: To offer visual aids that help users understand the MLflow interface and navigate their experiment results effectively.

### 3. `optimization-study-reports/`
Contains detailed Optuna study reports for the optimization of various models, including XGBoost (XGB), CatBoost (CAT), LightGBM (LGB), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

- **Purpose**: To document the results of hyperparameter optimization experiments, showcasing how different configurations impact model performance.

### 4. `optimization-reports/`
Stores reports generated if users run Optuna optimization again. This folder allows for tracking and comparing results from different optimization runs.

- **Purpose**: To maintain a record of updated optimization results and facilitate comparison between different runs of the optimization process.

### 5. `predictions/`
Contains the final predictions generated by the models. These predictions are the end results of the modeling process and are used for making informed business decisions.

- **Purpose**: To provide a repository for all final predictions, which can be analyzed or used for further decision-making.

### 6. `visuals/`
Includes visuals that illustrate key findings and plots explored during the analysis. These visuals are crucial for understanding the data and communicating insights effectively.

### 7.`mlruns/`
This directory is created to store mlflow experiments that i have done during the project. 

- **Purpose**: To present the key findings of the project in a visual format, making it easier to interpret and share insights with stakeholders.

## Purpose of the Reports Directory

The `reports/` directory serves as a comprehensive resource for documenting and visualizing various aspects of the project. It helps in understanding feature definitions, tracking optimization progress, and interpreting final predictions and key findings.
