# Models Directory

This directory contains the trained machine learning models used for making final predictions in the **Customer Churn Prediction Project**. Each model has been carefully trained, optimized, and evaluated to ensure the best performance on predicting customer churn.

## Structure

- **Trained Models:**
  - This folder stores the serialized versions of the models after training. Each model has been saved in a format that allows for easy reloading and inference.


## Reproducing the Results

The training scripts that generated these models can be found in the [`src/models/`](https://github.com/d-sutariya/custmer_churn_prediction/tree/main/src/models) directory. For details on how to retrain or optimize the models, refer to the [project setup documentation](https://custmer-churn-prediction.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/src.models.html).
