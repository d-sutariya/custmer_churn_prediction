Getting Started with Customer Churn Prediction
=============================================

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction Project**! If you're looking to work with a cutting-edge machine learning project that not only predicts customer churn but also provides a complete, production-ready solution, you've come to the right place.

*Are you ready to be impressed?* Dive in and let’s revolutionize how customer churn is predicted together.

**Follow the steps below to get the project up and running and uncover the secrets behind its success.**

1. **Project Setup: Getting Started the Right Way**
---------------------------------------------------

Before you dive into the data, let’s get your environment set up:

- **Clone the Project:**
  
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/d-sutariya/customer_churn_prediction.git
    ```
  
- **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
  
    ```
    python -m venv env
    # On Unix: source env/bin/activate
    # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
    ```

- **Install Dependencies:**
  
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- **Run the Setup Script:**

    ```
    python src/config/setup_project.py
    ```

*Now you're ready to transform raw data into valuable insights that could change business operations.*

2. **Transforming Raw Data: See the Magic Happen**
---------------------------------------------------

Transform raw customer data into a training-ready dataset with the following command:

- **Run the Transformation Script:**
  
    ```
    python src/data/make_dataset.py
    ```

*These notebooks are not just scripts—they are a window into the detailed thought process behind every step.*

4. **Production-Ready Scripts: Efficiency and Scalability**
----------------------------------------------------------

Head over to the `src/` directory to find core production scripts designed for efficiency and scalability:

- **ETL Pipeline Script:**
  
    - `src/data/make_dataset.py`

- **Data Pipeline Configuration:**
  
    - `src/pipeline/dvc.yaml`

- **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
  
    - `src/optimization/tuning_and_tracking.py`

*Imagine these scripts as part of your production pipeline. They are designed to be efficient and scalable.*

5. **Post-Deployment Magic: Ongoing Success**
---------------------------------------------------

The journey doesn’t end with deployment. The `post_deployment/` directory includes scripts for:

- Transforming new data.
- Periodically retraining the model.

*These scripts ensure your operations team stays ahead of potential issues and maintains model accuracy over time.*

6. **Final Thoughts: Dive Deep into What Sets This Apart**
-----------------------------------------------------------

I encourage you to explore this project thoroughly. From cutting-edge data transformations to production-ready pipelines, every piece has been crafted to address real-world problems.

*As you delve into the materials, I hope you see the value and potential of this project and how it could fit into your business.*

Feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback. I look forward to your thoughts!
