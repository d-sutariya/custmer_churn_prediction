# Documentation Overview

Welcome to the **Documentation** folder for the Customer Churn Prediction Project!

This folder contains all the essential files required to generate and maintain the project's documentation using the **Sphinx** documentation tool.

## Folder Structure

- **_build/**: This directory contains the generated documentation in HTML format. After building the documentation using Sphinx, the HTML files will be available here for viewing. You can open the `index.html` file in any web browser to browse the project documentation.
  
- **conf.py**: The configuration file for Sphinx. This file controls the settings for generating the documentation, including theme, extensions, and the paths to your source files. Any changes to the documentation's look and feel can be configured here.

- **.rst Files**: The `.rst` files are reStructuredText files that contain the actual content of the documentation. These are processed by Sphinx to generate the HTML documentation. Some key `.rst` files in this folder:
    - `index.rst`: The main entry point for your documentation.
    - `getting-started.rst`: A guide for setting up and using the project.
    - `commands.rst`: Lists any important commands for working with the project.
